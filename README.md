## What's ClienThings ?
**ClienThings** is a project to simulate more things client-side.
For example, if you eat food, the animation only ends when the server indicates it will.
This mod fixes that and therefore compensates for the ping.
You can use ClienThings on your server to find out if a player is using **ClienThings**.

Currently this mod compensates for :
- Consumables (95%)
- End Crystal (75%)
- Elytras
- Firework rocket
- Cooldowns
- Entity pose

Coming Soonâ„¢ :
- Void damage
- Interactions with blocks (Interfaces, Note block, Jukebox...)
- Interactions with items
- Interactions with entities
- Game mode change
- Potion Effects
- Tchat
- Sounds
- Crafting
- Weapons (Bow/Crossbow, etc.)
- Swap Items In Hands
- Pick Block
- Scaffolding
- Knockback (in some case)
- Fall damage (maybe)
- Wind charge (maybe)

#cooldowns: Enables or disables cooldowns prediction
#debugMode: Debug mode (for developers)

#firework_MaxTime: Maximum time (in ms) the server has to delete the firework
#pose: Enables or disables pose prediction

## How it works ?
Instead of waiting for an indication from the server, the client will simulate it at the right time, without delay.

## Disclaimer
On a very high ping, this mod may be detected as a cheat by some anti-cheats. Use with caution on public servers. (Even though there is very little chance of being banned)

## Compatibility
**ClienThings** should work on any client and server.
