## What's ClienThings ?
**ClienThings** is a project to simulate more things client-side.
For example, if you eat food, the animation only ends when the server indicates it will.
This mod fixes that and therefore compensates for the ping.

Currently this mod compensates for :
- Consumables (90%)
- Elytras (80%)

Coming Soonâ„¢ :
- Fall damage
- Interfaces
- End Crystal Placement (Use [Marlow Crystal Optimizer](https://modrinth.com/mod/marlow-crystal-optimizer) in the meantime)
- Knockback (in some case)
- Game mode change
- Firework rocket
- Potion Effects
- Chat
- Crafting
- Weapons (Bow/Crossbow, etc.)
- Note block
- Jukebox
- Swap Items In Hands
- Pick Block
- Scaffolding
- Splash Potion (maybe)
- Wind charge (maybe)
- Enderpearl (maybe)

## How it works ?
Instead of waiting for an indication from the server, the client will simulate it at the right time, without delay.
